- 🔴 Add `minAgeDays` configuration option.
  - ✅ Implement filtering based on age.
  - ✅ Add unit test for this option.
  - 🔴 Describe in README.md why this option is helpful in the light of the latest supply chain attack (Shai Hulud).
- ✅ Rewrite all tests to test `VerdaccioMiddlewarePlugin` instead of `filterBlockedVersions()`.
  - ✅ Remove export for filterBlockedVersions().
- ✅ Fix `dist-tags/latest` still contains version that was filtered out.
- ✅ Make `dist-tags/latest` set to latest version after filtering.
- ✅ Fix `time` property still contains entries for versions that were cut.
- ✅ Fix side effects of not cloning package under some conditions.
- ✅ Fix `minAgeDays` sets `dateThreshold` internally.
  Server can be run for days/months and `dateThreshold` will stay fixed
  while user expects age to be calculated based on the current date.
  - ✅ Compare version age with minAgeDays in each `filter_metadata()` call.
  - ✅ Add unit test checking that earliest effective date threshold is applied.
- ✅ Fix `created` and `modified` are removed from `time`.
  - ✅ Recalculate `created` and `modified` and write to `time`.
  - ✅ Update tests accordingly. Add `created` and `modified` to initial data.
- ✅ Fix `filterBlockedVersions()` should not update readme when no actual changes to package were made.
- 🔴 Test that block by version does not modify readme when nothing was changed.
- 🔴 Test that replace by version does not modify readme when nothing was changed.
- ✅ Test that `dateThreshold` setting works.
- 🔴 Update README.md:
  - ✅ Split config into several task-based sections.
  - 🔴 Describe main intent of this package - filtering versions by age to prevent 0-day attacks.
  - ✅ Describe configuration of `minAgeDays` parameter.
  - 🔴 Describe installation more thoroughly. It's not enough to just run `npm install -g`.
  - 🔴 Mention where to configure "filters:" (config.yaml verdaccio).
  - ✅ Remove deprecation from `dateThreshold` parameter. It's not that useless actually.
- ✅ Do not compile index.test.ts into lib/index.test.js. It should not end up in distrubution files.
- 🔴 Fix vulnerabilities revealed by npm audit: 39 vulnerabilities (7 low, 18 moderate, 14 high).
